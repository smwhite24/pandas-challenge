School Summary

Top Performing Schools:

	•	Schools such as Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, and Pena High School lead in overall passing rates, exceeding 95%. 


Bottom Performing Schools:

	•	Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, and Huang High School have lower overall passing rates, around 73%. They are all district schools.


Impact of School Type:

	•	Charter schools consistently outperform district schools across all metrics, including average scores and passing rates. This suggests that the charter school model may contribute positively to academic achievement. 

 School Size:

	•	Smaller and medium-sized schools (under 2000 students) generally exhibit higher average scores and passing rates compared to larger schools. This trend indicates potential benefits in managing smaller student populations.

	•	Schools with a per student budget less than $585 show the highest average math score (83.46) and reading score (83.93).

	•	As spending per student increases, there is a slight decrease in average scores. Schools in the highest spending range ($645-675) have the lowest average math score (76.99) and reading score (81.03).

Next Steps:

	•	Further analysis on policies and practices from high-performing charter schools to identify strategies that could be implemented in district schools to enhance student engagement and academic support, particularly in the larger schools. 

	•	Identifying how high performing schools with mid -low budget allocate their funds for success.
